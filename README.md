##  Project Description 
Tracking via ultra-wideband (UWB) is a project that aims to achieve a battery-powered asset-tracking device through the LoRaWAN communication protocol.
This project is a small, compact tracking device featuring major components including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Global Positioning System (GPS), and UWB.

## ü§ñ Schematics

The schematics are all on one sheet. This schematic sheet contains symbols and connections for highspeed USB-C, ESP32-C6FH8 (with internal flash), DWl0001 Ultrawide module, Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC), A buzzer, and a Global Positioning System (GPS).

## UWB Specifics 
### Module Positioning (UWB)
The antenna-related diagrams below are references from the DWl001 Datasheet. 
The DWM1001 antenna is vertically polarised, meaning that the module is intended to be positioned vertically
upright when used in an RTLS system.

### UWB Chip Placement Guidelines (DW1001)
The proximity of the DWM1001 on-board
antenna to metal and other non-RF transparent materials needs to be considered carefully.
For best RF performance, ground copper should be flooded in all areas of the application board, except
in the areas marked ‚ÄúKeep-Out Area‚Äù, where there should be no metal on either side, above or below (e.g.
do not place any battery under the antenna).
