# Tracking Via Ultra-wideband(UWB)+GPS+LoRa
A high-precision tracking module designed for close-range tracking via ultra-wideband and long-distance tracking via GPS.




## UWB Specifics 
### Module Positioning (UWB)
The antenna-related diagrams below are lifted from the DWl001 Datasheet for the sake of referencing and clarity. 
The DWM1001 antenna is vertically polarised, meaning that the module is intended to be positioned vertically
upright when used in an RTLS system.
